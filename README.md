# ML-algorithms-implementations
Step-by-step implementation of individual ML algorithms along with a comparison of operation with the ready-made implementation from sklearn.

1. **Logistic regression**:

   This file contains an example implementation of logistic regression using the **gradient descent method**. The function also has the **mini bach** and **squared gradients sum** algorithms, they were added to optimize the function. The algorithm's performance was tested on two synthetic data sets.

2. **SVM**

   In this file you will find an SVM implementation with three different kernels (**linear**, **poly** and **RBF**). You will also find a test of each of the above kernels and a comparison of the performance of the 
 sklearn SVM with mine implementation

**coming soon:**
1. **Linear/Poly Regression**
2. **Linear Classification**
3. **Decision Tree**
4. **Random Forest**
