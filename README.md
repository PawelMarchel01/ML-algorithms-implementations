# ML algorithms step by step implementations
Step-by-step implementation of individual ML algorithms along with a comparison of operation with the ready-made implementation from sklearn.

1. **Linear/Poly Regression**: coming soon!

2. **Linear Classification**: coming soon!

3. **Logistic Regression**:

   This file contains an example implementation of logistic regression using the **gradient descent method**. The function also has the **mini bach** and **squared gradients sum** algorithms, they were added to optimize the function. The algorithm's performance was tested on two synthetic data sets.

4. **SVM**:

   In this file you will find an SVM implementation with three different kernels (**linear**, **poly** and **RBF**). You will also find a test of each of the above kernels and a comparison of the performance of the 
 sklearn SVM with mine implementation.

5. **Decision Tree**:
   
   Implementation of a decision tree (with **entropy minimization**) along with a test on single and multi-mode data sets.

6. **Random Forest**:
     1. **RandomForest** - Full implementation of the Random Forest algorithm along with a comparison of its performance with the sklearn version, on single and multi-mode data sets.
     2. **DecisionTree** - Implementation of a Decision Tree (with **Ginni reduction**).
