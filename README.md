# ML-algorithms-implementations
Step-by-step implementation of individual ML algorithms along with a comparison of operation with the ready-made implementation from sklearn.

1. **Logistic regression**:

   This file contains an example implementation of logistic regression using the **gradient descent method**. The function also has the **mini bach** and **squared gradients sum** algorithms, they were added to optimize the task. The algorithm's performance was tested on two synthetic data sets.
